Hi everyone! few weeks ago I annouced that I'm leaving my position at [eHealth Africa](https://www.ehealthafrica.org) where I have spent the last 4 years. It's been amazing and a wonderful experience for me working for NGOs having a direct impact on people's life especially in remote areas. But if you look at my career history and especial my old github repos, you will noticed that I a have a passion for developers tools; especially compilers, databases and search engines.

Hi everyone! few weeks ago I annouced that I'm leaving my position at [eHealth Africa](https://www.ehealthafrica.org) where I have spent the last 4 years. It's been amazing and a wonderful experience for me working for NGOs having a direct impact on people's life especially in remote areas. But if you look at my career history and especial my old github repos, you will noticed that I a have a passion for developers tools; especially compilers, databases and search engines. I have been so lucky to be offered a position at [Quickwit Inc](https://quickwit.io/) where I am working as software engeenier. It has been a wonderful experience and the transition for the past three weeks has been amazing. Given how cool and helpful my colleagues have been, I can only be greateful and say a big thank to them for giving the chance to be part of this journey.

### On relocating
I had to relocated back to my home country (Guinea) for the time being. I have to admit that it's not been that smooth because I have been in Nigeria for the past few years (-missing quiet few people). Internet is better now in Guinea than it used to be it's still as expensive as any precious stone. Traffic is hectic so I do my best to stay at home as much as possible. Probably a positive given the pandemic situation. On a positive note, I am currently spending more time with my son Alex ü•∞.

### About Quickwit
Quickwit is a company currently building a search engine product and the plan is offer a better  and cheaper alternative to current key players in the field. The company open source search library [Tantivy](https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy) is already production grade and available on [Github](https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy) . if you are a developer,  try it; give feedback and possibly contribute.


### Plans for the rest of the year
My goal at the begining of 2021 was to be able to get a system programming job mostly using Rust.  Given the fact that has been checked very quickly, I think the plan is to know the ins & outs and contribute more to our product. I want to use this wonderful oportunity to become a search engine go to person üòä. I also plan to release later during the year some open source projects I have been working on. I also hope to keep learning more about distributed databases & storage systems. 
Of course you should expect to see more post relating to search engines and particularly tantivy internals from now on üòä.

I hope this post gave you updates on what I have been am up to and until next time, stay safe. Covid-19 is still around. May God bless & protect us all üôè.
