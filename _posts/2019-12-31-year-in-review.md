Hello everyone, in today's post, I will try my best to enumerate things I have been doing over the past twelve months.

<!--more-->

**Note**:  I won't go in details about my process, there are certainly better career coaches for various advice.

First and foremost, I am not great at looking back especially when it comes to reviewing a year in which I achieved most of the goals I set to myself. Maybe the challenge was not so big as I completed the most important one around September. I would like to spend a line thanking God for the thriving energy, health, and discipline he has always given me. Hoping he keeps doing the same for many years to come.

At the end of 2018, I decided to move towards system programming in order to get away from Javascript fatigue. I have been building skills in that regard and looking back, I am so far impressed with my current level. Bellow, I will enumerate a non-exaustive list of all the things I accomplished or failed during the past twelve months.

Did or failed in 2019:
* ✅ Mastered C++ & Rust
* ✅ Learned concurency theadring/async in Python, Rust and C++
* ✅ Mastered compilers construction thanks to [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/@munificentbob){:target="_blank"} & [Thorsten Ball](https://twitter.com/@thorstenball){:target="_blank"}
* ✅ Read 15 programming books (9 of which I fully implemented code)
* 😡 Wrote only 4 blog posts (need to improve 😱)
* 😡 Personal projects were not completed (should avoid side gigs 💰)
* 😡 Only went fron 45 to 127 twitter followers (so bad 😱)

Plans for the new year:
* Master database engines and distributed systems [3 courses to take]
* Complete & release personal projects
* Find a system programming position 🙏
* Share knowledge via blog/youtube post (improve Twitter presence)
* Contribute to Open Source (one of Rust, NodeJS, C++)
* Most importantly ⭐ Find that life partner to plan... 💑 ⭐


Once again I thank the Lord for such a blessing life. I wish you all and family a wonderfull year of 2020 🙏.
