Writing an app with beautiful UI in Winform is not an easy task, especially if you don't get the amount to buy component from big companies.

However with litle time an effort you can achieve nearly perfection in UI design with Winform. Throughout the last couple days, I have been playing around UI design in order to make one of our app stand-out. WPF is great, but we do not have time and money to spend WPF tools and coordinated workflow. We do not have an in-house designer either.

This is what I have been able to achieve on our Pharma Express  which is based on our business app framework Baboon.

Pretty neat hein? along the way I have put together an image Library usable throughout many other applications; You can use the resource browser to copy the name of the icon and use it in code. 

The ImageLibrary contains iconsets from famfam, Fugu, eclipse IDE, VS 2010, V2012 and VS2013. To use it in your application, just add the Baboon.ImageLibrary.dll to your project as a reference.
