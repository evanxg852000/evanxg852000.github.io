Hi, I am so happy that you are reading this.
I am Evance Soumaoro, I am a software engineer from Conakry (Guinea). I have been programming professionally for more than 10 years, and I am still loving it. On the left, it's me and my wonderful son Alexandre :heart:.  

Currently, I am a software engineer at [Quickwit Inc](https://quickwit.io/){:target="_blank"} working on the next generation of [Search Engines](https://github.com/quickwit-inc/quickwit){:target="_blank"}. Prior to my current position, I worked as a software developer at [eHealth Africa](https://www.ehealthafrica.org){:target="_blank"} where I focus on developing public health surveillance apps, as well as disease outbreak response systems in West Africa. With my experience with NGOs, I currently act as software development consultant for the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/){:target="_blank"} in the West African region. I also developed biometric and identification systems at ETI (Conakry, Guinea) and lead the development of a J2SE eLearning platform at After School Study (London, UK). 

I have professionally developed application in Rust, Golang, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Javascript and Python. Nowadays, I am focus on backend and system programming. I am passionate about low-level programming and performance tuning; always interested in compilers, database engines, concurrency, and emulators.

I love playing and watching soccer, reading software development books, listening any type of music. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/evanxg852000){:target="_blank"}. You also can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evance-soumaoro-76898426/){:target="_blank"}
